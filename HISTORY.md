# createsend-java history

## v5.1.0 - 28 Jul 2015

* Transactional API

## v5.0.0 - 6 Feb, 2014

* Updated to v3.1 API
* Added support for new segments structure
  * Segment now includes a new `RuleGroup[] RuleGroups` member, instead of a `Rule[] Rules` member.

    ```java
   	public RuleGroup[] RuleGroups;
    ```

    So for example, when you _previously_ would have created a segment like so:

    ```java
	segment.Rules = new Rule[] {new Rule()};
    segment.Rules[0].Subject = "EmailAddress";
    segment.Rules[0].Clauses = new String[] {"CONTAINS example.com"};
    ```

    You would _now_ do this:

    ```java
    segment.RuleGroups = new RuleGroup[] {new RuleGroup()};
    segment.RuleGroups[0].Rules = new Rule[] {new Rule()};
    segment.RuleGroups[0].Rules[0].RuleType = "EmailAddress";
    segment.RuleGroups[0].Rules[0].Clause = "CONTAINS example.com";
    ```
    
  * The Add Rule call is now Add Rule Group, taking a `RuleGroup` in a `ruleGroup` argument instead of a rule argument.

    ```java
 	public void Segment.addRuleGroup(RuleGroup ruleGroup)
    ```

    So for example, when you _previously_ would have added a rule like so:

    ```java
	Rule rule = new Rule();
    rule.Subject = "EmailAddress";
    rule.Clauses = new String[] {"CONTAINS @hello.com"};
    segmentAPI.addRule(rule);
    ```

    You would _now_ do this:

    ```java
    RuleGroup extraRuleGroup = new RuleGroup();
    extraRuleGroup.Rules = new Rule[] {new Rule()};
    extraRuleGroup.Rules[0].RuleType = "EmailAddress";
    extraRuleGroup.Rules[0].Clause = "CONTAINS @hello.com";
    segmentAPI.addRuleGroup(extraRuleGroup);
    ```
* Removed the getAPIKey method to promote usage of oAuth authentication

## v4.0.1 - 16 Jan, 2014

* Removed jersey-apache-client reference due to vulnerability. See #20.

## v4.0.0 - 24 Oct, 2013

* [Campaign bounces should include Reason and BounceType](https://github.com/campaignmonitor/createsend-java/issues/18). This introduces a breaking change to the return type of ```com.createsend.Campaigns.bounces``` from ```com.createsend.models.PagedResult<com.createsend.models.subscribers.Subscriber>``` to ```com.createsend.models.PagedResult<com.createsend.models.subscribers.BouncedSubscriber>```.
  * If you're using this method, upgrading to this version will require you to update any code to use the new signature. For example

  ```
  PagedResult<Subscriber> bouncedSubscribers = campaigns.bounces();
  ```

  would need to be updated to

  ```
  PagedResult<BouncedSubscriber> bouncedSubscribers = campaigns.bounces();
  ```

## v3.1.3 - 21 June, 2013

* Improve error handling and determination of generic error handling.

## v3.1.2 - 5 June, 2013

* Correctly configure the date format used by our JsonProvider. See #16.

## v3.1.1 - 15 May, 2013

* Updated `com.sun.jersey` and `org.codehaus.jackson` dependencies to the latest versions.

## v3.1.0 - 16 Apr, 2013

* Added support for [single sign on](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/account/#single_sign_on) which allows initiation of external login sessions to Campaign Monitor.

## v3.0.0 - 25 Mar, 2013

* Added support for authenticating using OAuth. See the [README](README.md#authenticating) for full usage instructions.
* Refactored authentication so that it is _always_ done at the instance level. This introduces some breaking changes, which are clearly explained below.
  * Authentication using an API key is no longer supported using the `config.properties` or `createsend.properties` files.

      So if you _previously_ entered your API key into a properties file as follows:

      ```
      createsend.apikey = your api key
      ```

      If you want to authenticate with an API key, you should _now_ always authenticate at the instance level. For example, as follows:

      ```java
      import com.createsend.Clients;
      import com.createsend.models.campaigns.SentCampaign;
      import com.createsend.util.ApiKeyAuthenticationDetails;
      import com.createsend.util.exceptions.CreateSendException;

      public class Tester {
          public static void main(String[] args) throws CreateSendException {
              ApiKeyAuthenticationDetails auth = new ApiKeyAuthenticationDetails(
                  "your api key");
              Clients clients = new Clients(auth, "your client id");
              SentCampaign[] campaigns = clients.sentCampaigns();
          }
      }
      ```
